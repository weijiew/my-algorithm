# 1003 Emergency (25 分) 

As an emergency rescue team leader of a city, you are given a special map of your country. The map shows several scattered cities connected by some roads. Amount of rescue teams in each city and the length of each road between any pair of cities are marked on the map. When there is an emergency call to you from some other city, your job is to lead your men to the place as quickly as possible, and at the mean time, call up as many hands on the way as possible.

作为一个城市紧急救援小组的领导，你将会得到一张你的城市的特殊地图。这张地图中有一些被路连接的分散的城市。每一个城市救援队的数量和每一对城市之间道路的距离都在地图中。当有紧急电话从某地打给你时，你需要带领你的队员尽可能迅速的到达，同时在路上召集尽可能多的人手。

## Input Specification: 输入格式

Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains 4 positive integers: N (≤500) - the number of cities (and the cities are numbered from 0 to N−1), M - the number of roads, $C_​1$ and $C_2$ - the cities that you are currently in and that you must save, respectively. The next line contains N integers, where the i-th integer is the number of rescue teams in the i-th city. Then M lines follow, each describes a road with three integers c_1 , c_2 and L, which are the pair of cities connected by a road and the length of that road, respectively. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one path from C_​1 to C_2.

每一个输入包含了一个测试用例。每一个测试用例中，第一行包含了四个正整数：N 城市的数量（小于等于 500），其中城市的标号分别是 0 - (N-1) ，M 是道路的数量，$C_1$ 和 $C_2$ 分别是你当前所在和你要到达的城市。下一行包含了 N 个整数，第 i 个整数是救援队在第 i 个城市的数字。接下来的 M 行，每一行包含了三个整数 c_1, c_2 和 L，表示一对城市被长度为 L 的道路所链接。保证从 C_1 到 C_2 之间必有一条路链接。

## Output Specification: 输出格式

For each test case, print in one line two numbers: the number of different shortest paths between C_​1 and C_2, and the maximum amount of rescue teams you can possibly gather. All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there is no extra space allowed at the end of a line.

对于每一个测试，每一行打印两个数字：数字表示两个城市之间的最短路径和你所能聚集的最大数量的营救队伍。所有数字都在一行内，并且被一个空格分隔开，每一行的末尾没有额外的空格。
